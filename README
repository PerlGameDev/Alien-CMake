NAME
    Alien::CMake - Build and make available CMake library -
    <http://cmake.org/>

VERSION
    Version 0.08

SYNOPSIS
    Alien::CMake during its installation does one of the following:

    *   Builds *CMake* binaries from source codes and installs dev files
        (headers: *.h, static library: *.a) into *share* directory of
        Alien::CMake distribution.

    Later you can use Alien::CMake in your module that needs to link with
    *libode* like this:

        # Sample Build.pl
        use Module::Build;
        use Alien::CMake;

        my $build = Module::Build->new(
          module_name => 'Any::CMake::Module',
          # + other params
          build_requires => {
                        'Alien::CMake' => 0,
                        # + others modules
          },
          configure_requires => {
                        'Alien::CMake' => 0,
                        # + others modules
          },
          extra_compiler_flags => Alien::CMake->config('cflags'),
          extra_linker_flags   => Alien::CMake->config('libs'),
        )->create_build_script;

    NOTE: Alien::CMake is required only for building not for using
    'Any::CMake::Module'.

DESCRIPTION
    In short "Alien::CMake" can be used to detect and get configuration
    settings from an already installed CMake. It offers also an option to
    download CMake source codes and build binaries from scratch.

METHODS
  config()
    This function is the main public interface to this module:

        Alien::CMake->config('prefix');
        Alien::CMake->config('version');
        Alien::CMake->config('libs');
        Alien::CMake->config('cflags');

  bin_dir()
    For compatability with Alien::Base, this will return the path containing
    "cmake" or empty list if it is already in the "PATH".
